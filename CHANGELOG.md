# Changelog

All notable changes to RepCheck are recorded here, newest first.

## [0.1.2.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- HYROX: the setup screen no longer shows a second copy of your personal bests.
  The same board lives on the history screen, one tap away behind the hero's
  "Personal bests" link, so the setup screen was saying it twice.

## [0.1.1.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- HYROX: a flagged race no longer tells you it wasn't saved. Beat the realistic-time
  floor and the finish screen said the race was "not saved to your history" — then the
  history screen listed it, under a heading reading "Saved times". It always was saved;
  what it doesn't do is count toward your personal bests or the leaderboard, which is
  what the message says now.
- HYROX: the landing card no longer counts your races and calls you a first-timer in the
  same breath. If every race you'd run was a custom one (or got flagged), the header
  showed "11 races" directly above "Your first race awaits", and it never resolved no
  matter how many more you ran. It now says you have no ranked time yet, and why.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- HYROX: you can start a race again after picking a category and format. If your
  profile had no gender saved, Start race was permanently greyed out and tapping
  it did nothing — and because the race length, training space, and race agenda
  steps all wait on that same answer, the page sat there as a near-empty card
  with a dead button. Race setup now asks the question itself when it has no
  answer to work from, and keeps asking until this race actually has one.
